🖼️ Image Recognition using CNN on CIFAR-10

🚀 Overview

This project implements an image classification model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to recognize objects from the popular CIFAR-10 dataset, which contains 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 classes.

The goal is to build, train, and evaluate a deep learning model that can accurately classify images into their respective categories.
